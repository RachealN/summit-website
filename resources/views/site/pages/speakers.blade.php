                            <p>The President of Uganda, H.E. Yoweri Museveni, launched the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) 2021-2025 for Uganda at a ceremony attended by Heads of UN Agencies in Uganda and Senior Government officials at State House, Entebbe. The UN Resident Coordinator in Uganda, H.E. Ms. Rosa Malango signed the UNSDCF on behalf of the United Nations Secretary-General.

                                “The UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework comes at the opportune time to contribute to National Vision 2040 and the Third National Development Plan 2020/21 – 2024/25 (NDP III). I also hope we will further deepen the focus on youth employment, entrepreneurship and education programmes, including access to reproductive health information and services,” said President Museveni.</p>

                                “With the Sustainable Development Goals at its core, the UNSDCF enables 31 UN entities to implement programmes through three Strategic Priorities: 1) Transformative and Inclusive Governance; 2) Shared Prosperity in a Healthy Environment; and 3) Human Well-being and Resilience,” said Ms. Malango.

UN General Assembly Resolution 72/279, on the repositioning of the UN Development System, positions the UNSDCF as the  most important UN country planning instrument in support of the 2030 Agenda. The current Uganda UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) will be ending on 31 December 2020.

Guided by the United Nations Uganda’s vision of contributing to a transformed, inclusive Ugandan Society where people have improved quality of life and resilience for Sustainable Development, and building on the successes of the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) 2016-2020, the UNSDCF 2021-25 will support the Government of Uganda to accelerate development and social transformation across Uganda as outlined in Vision 2040 and the third National Development Plan (NDPIII).

Issues that have hitherto remained constraints must be shared and addressed if we are to make sustainable development a reality.

                                Our experiences in working towards this goal should form the basis on which we work out, in strategic partnership,- practical ways of implementing Agenda 21 - especially issues pertaining to water, energy, health, agriculture, biodiversity, environment, poverty, education, children and gender.
